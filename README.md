# monkey

for Vlang Bug Report.

There is a design flaw in this code that I overlooked, 

when I try to run `parser_precedence_test.v`, it keeps calling `prefix_expr()` indefinitely and causes a stack overflow.

This repository is left for the preservation of [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) Issues.
